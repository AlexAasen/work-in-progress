  {
    question: "Why did you choose to become a front-end developer?",
    answer: "Ever since I was a little girl I’ve liked three things, to paint, play videogames and well, calculus. I’ve always had a hard time combining the creative parts of myself with the analytical, logical parts. I studied science in high school only to pursue art in college in the form of game design, to later find myself studying back-end programming. After a lot of trial and error and a single course in front-end technology, I finally found something that all parts of me enjoy."

  {
    question: "What do you love most about your work?",
    answer: "That I get to bring ideas to life. (And I get to solve a bunch of problems while doing it!)"
  },
  {
    question: "What is a skill you’d like to learn and why?",
    answer: "I recently made a country style desk for me and my boyfriend which has made me very interested in carpentry. I’d love to learn more and maybe even learn the basics of woodworking for some potential projects at home."
  },
  {
    question: "What are your top three favorite books and why?",
    answer: "I’m a sucker for the young adults franchise, especially those containing faeries with a dash of romance and monsters. My top three series are a court of thorns and roses, throne of glass and the cruel prince (all of which match the aforementioned criteria). They also have a strong female protagonist, something that’s very important to me."
  },
  {
    question: "What are you most afraid of?",
    answer: "Bugs, literally terrified. I hate summers because of it, and if I see one in the apartment I spend the upcoming two weeks looking for more before I finally trust my home again and relax."
  },
  {
    question: "What are your goals for the future?",
    answer: "To keep on growing as an individual and as a developer, and to never stop learning new things."
