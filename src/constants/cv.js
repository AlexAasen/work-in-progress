      description: "My time at Uppsala university was spent creating games. Each project consisted of 2-3 graphics students pairing up with 2-3 programmers to create something fun. The time spent with each project taught me the importance of each member in a team, and how important it is for me as an individual to be effective in my work and to never miss a deadline. It also made me more flexible as a developer as you often found yourself in situations where you had to rethink your entire game. Either because the game wasn't fun to play or because the team ended up not having enough experience to implement certain features during the given time."
